Every day, more industries resort to computer vision processes to fasten and ease a variety of operations including the handling and processing of printed circuit boards (PCBs). Working with small electronics components such as PCBs requires a combination of technical knowledge, precision, and attention to detail. This often results in high costs and long processing times. Computer vision operations can be used to automate many of the tasks involved in working with PCBs, making the process faster, more accurate, and less prone to errors.

At the top of the wide range of industries which are currently employing computer vision technologies for PCBs we can find:

- **Electronics manufacturing:** Computer vision is widely used in the electronics manufacturing industry to perform automated optical inspection (AOI) on PCBs to ensure that they meet the required specifications and to identify and correct defects before the boards are shipped to customers.

- **Automotive**: Many vehicles use PCBs in their electrical systems, and computer vision can be used to inspect and assemble these boards in a more efficient and accurate way.

- **Aerospace**: PCBs are also used in the aerospace industry for control systems, navigation systems and communication systems. Computer vision is used to ensure the quality and performance of these PCBs, as well as to track them during the manufacturing process.

- **Robotics**: Computer vision is used to help robots with tasks like assembling PCBs, which is a critical part of the manufacturing process for many robotics systems.

- **Medical Devices**: Computer vision can be used to ensure the quality of PCBs used in medical devices, to analyse images and information, and to control and inspect medical devices during production.

- **IoT**: The Internet of Things industry is growing and many of the devices that make up IoT require PCBs. Computer vision plays a key role in testing and manufacturing those boards.

## Which operations can be performed with the help of computer vision? 

- **Quality control**

Computer vision algorithms can be used to inspect PCBs for defects and to ensure that the PCBs meet the specifications required for proper functioning. In the PCB inspection process, for instance, cameras and software are used to inspect PCBs for defects such as **missing or misaligned components, and soldering defects**. These systems can also be used to verify that the correct components have been placed on the board, and that the component values are correct. This is done by comparing the images of the PCBs with a reference image and identifying any discrepancies.

- **Automatic optical inspection (AOI)** 

Computer vision can be used to perform AOI on PCBs during manufacturing, which can help to **identify and correct defects in advance**, before the boards are shipped to customers.

- **Automatic assembly **

Robots can be guided in assembling PCBs with the help of computer vision. This can increase the efficiency and accuracy of the assembly process by making use of vision systems to locate and identify the component on a PCB, even **at high speeds**, which can be fed to a robotic assembly machine to pick and place with **high accuracy**.

- **Traceability and tracking **

Computer vision can be used to **identify and track the location of PCBs** during the manufacturing process, which can help to ensure that the correct components are used on the correct boards, and that the boards are assembled in the correct order.

- **Object Detection** 

Computer Vision can be used to detect specific parts or features on PCBs, to **provide information** that can be used for analysis or control.

Finally, computer vision plays a vital role in the PCB industry. Not only is it used to boost the quality and speed of inspection, testing, and assembly processes of PCBs, but it can also improve accuracy and help to reduce the risk of errors to increase productivity overall.
