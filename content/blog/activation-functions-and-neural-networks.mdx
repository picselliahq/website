## Introduction

Let's say we want to predict the finalists of the Rugby World Cup. Instead of relying solely on human analysis, we can use a Deep Learning model.

The model would be trained on historical data of Rugby World Cup matches, including team performances and outcomes. By applying successive transformations to the input data using activation functions, the model learns complex patterns and relationships.

Once trained, the model takes in the recent performances of participating teams as input. It uses activation functions to process the data and make predictions about the two teams most likely to reach the finals.

This article aims to explore various activation functions commonly employed in computer vision tasks. We will delve into their properties, discuss advantages and limitations, and provide specific examples to illustrate their applications in different scenarios.

## Understanding Neural Networks

Before we dive into the intricacies of activation functions, let's briefly recap the concept of neural networks in computer vision. Neural networks, inspired by the complexity of the human brain, consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons. There is an input and output layer, linked by hidden layers as shown on the figure.  Each hidden layer is made with neurons connected to one or several neurons from the previous and following layer. Neurons are actually function.

To simplify: if we look at the input data as a starting point and the output data as an end point, we can see the neural network as a combination of the paths that the input data takes to arrive at the result.

Through the training process, these networks learn to recognize patterns and make predictions by adjusting the weights and biases of these neurons. 

### The Weights

Weights represent the coefficients within a neural network's equation. When training a neural network using a training dataset, it begins with a predetermined set of weights. These weights are subsequently adjusted and optimized during the training process to achieve the best possible values.

It happens during the training process through a technique called backpropagation combined with gradient descent. 

- **Initialization:** The first step consists in randomly initializing the weights, each weight representing a parameter that determines the influence of a particular feature or filter in the network.
- **Forward Propagation**: During forward propagation, input data is fed into the network, and the weights are used to compute the output predictions. The predictions are then compared to the actual labels to calculate the loss, which represents the discrepancy between the predicted and actual values.
- **Backpropagation**: In this step, the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights are computed using the chain rule of calculus. The gradients indicate the direction and magnitude of the weight adjustments needed to reduce the loss.
- **Gradient Descent**: The computed gradients are used to update the weights in the network. Gradient descent is employed, which involves taking small steps in the direction opposite to the gradients, aiming to minimize the loss. The learning rate determines the size of these steps.
- **Iterative Optimization:** Steps 2-4 are repeated iteratively over the training dataset. Each iteration is known as an epoch. As the training progresses, the network gradually learns to adjust its weights to reduce the loss and improve the accuracy of its predictions.
- **Convergence: **The training process continues until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum number of epochs or observing a negligible improvement in performance.

By repeatedly adjusting the weights based on the computed gradients, the CNN learns to recognize meaningful patterns and features in the input data, optimizing the weights to achieve the best possible values for accurate predictions.

### The Bias

Bias, on the other hand, is a fixed value that is added to the product of inputs and weights. It serves as the opposite of the threshold, determining when to activate the activation function. In essence, the bias value governs the decision-making process of the activation function.

Activation functions play a pivotal role in this process, acting as nonlinear transformations applied to the outputs of these neurons, enabling them to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. 

## Importance of Activation Functions in Neural Networks

Neural networks without activation functions would be limited to representing linear transformations, rendering them inadequate for solving complex problems. Activation functions introduce nonlinearity, enabling neural networks to capture intricate patterns and make more accurate predictions. By applying a suitable activation function, the network's expressive power increases exponentially, allowing it to learn and generalize from complex datasets.
