Anomaly detection systems are essential in various industry applications. With computer vision (CV), they can search for and pinpoint visual elements deviating from the norm. It helps optimize workflow and enable the efficient execution of tasks. There are many variables to consider when designing or using vision anomaly systems, especially when used for a custom solution. 

Computer vision based anomaly detection systems used in industry usually consist of hardware and software components. The structure of the technical components allows bottlenecks to emerge at the software, hardware, or integration level. On the other hand, the operational factors surrounding each industry's applications introduce tradeoffs and challenges that vary across and within different industries. Engineering professionals, quality control experts, and domain experts continually work together to squeeze every last drop of accuracy, performance, and resilience from computer vision-based anomaly systems.

This article examines the quality and operational implications of employing different forms of computer vision-based anomaly detection systems in the manufacturing industry.

## **Anomaly Detection in Manufacturing Using Computer Vision**

Defect detection tasks in manufacturing commonly include predictive maintenance, quality control, process optimization, safety monitoring, root cause analysis, inventory management, demand forecasting, or logistics. As part of the[ Industry 4.0](https://www.sap.com/africa/products/scm/industry-4-0/what-is-industry-4-0.html) initiative, computer vision-based anomaly detection systems introduce advanced methods to handle such tasks and improve manufacturing processes.

In manufacturing, computer vision systems analyze images and videos captured at various stages in production lines or processes for unusual patterns, events, or deviations that may indicate potential problems or defects. Computer vision systems for identifying anomalies in manufacturing lines can take several forms, ranging from product defects and process deviations to safety hazard identification. By adopting computer vision, manufacturers can enhance product quality, optimize productivity, increase efficiency, minimize safety hazards, improve precision, and reduce downtime.
