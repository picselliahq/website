A diverse set of skills is needed to successfully develop a computer vision project. While trying to adapt to the different operational workflows of professionals, computer vision teams face workflow challenges when delivering ML. The maturity level of a project dictates a team's structure and infrastructural setup. At the beginning of a CV project, you will need data engineers and data scientists to manipulate and experiment with the data. Once you start getting to a point where the data has translated into a machine learning (ML) solution, you need to scale up and manage complicated workflows, and an ML engineer is introduced into the mix. These different roles that work in disparate environments using disparate tools are sometimes error-prone and nonoptimal. Ideally, utilizing an ML/MLOps platform from the start manages the complexity of various tools and infrastructure in a CV team for multiple disciplines, enabling all experts to build and interact seamlessly.

This article will discuss different roles in a typical computer vision team and their responsibilities. We also discuss the most effective way to promote optimal collaboration between CV team roles and their workflows.
