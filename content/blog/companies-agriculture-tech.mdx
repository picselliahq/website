The agriculture industry has undergone significant transformations over time in response to the rising sustenance needs of the global population. With the world population expected to hit [9.8 billion](https://www.un.org/en/desa/world-population-projected-reach-98-billion-2050-and-112-billion-2100) by 2050, there is increasing pressure on the sector to produce food efficiently and sustainably to ensure food security. 

Technology helps tackle these challenges, and agricultural technology (AgTech) startups are a big part of this progress. 

They drive innovation and address agricultural challenges, such as food security, labor shortages, and climate change issues. 

The agtech market is growing fast. In [2021](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1222528/worldwide-agricultural-technology-market-value/), it was valued at $10.5 billion, and it’s expected to more than double by 2025.

Let’s talk about the latest agtech trends and the top startups in the agtech space. 

## Agtech Trends to Watch Out

Like other tech-driven sectors, agriculture is rapidly evolving, with innovative solutions emerging yearly. Here are some top agtech trends to watch in 2024 and beyond.

### 1. Vertical Farming

Vertical farming is gaining traction, with over [2,000 hydroponics farms](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/united-states-vertical-farming-market) operating in the U.S. This method involves growing crops in stacked layers, often inside warehouses or other controlled environments. 

These farms can maximize yield by using vertical space while minimizing the land needed for cultivation.  Moreover, the crops are grown without soil, relying instead on hydroponics or aeroponics. Light, moisture, and temperature are carefully controlled to optimize growing conditions. 

Companies like [Phillips](https://www.lighting.philips.com/application-areas/specialist-applications/horticulture/vertical-farming) have even developed specialized LED lighting systems that allow farmers to fine-tune the color and intensity of light.

### 2. Digital Twins to Optimize Field Trials 

Digital twin technology creates virtual replicas of farms that can help monitor and analyze conditions in real time. These digital models integrate data from soil sensors, weather forecasts, and satellite imagery to provide valuable insights into crop health and environmental factors.

Farmers can use this information to make better irrigation, fertilization, and pest management decisions. However, the technology is still in its infancy and has [challenges](https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9292/13/11/2209), including obtaining sensor data and the costs associated with developing digital twins.  

### 3. Satellite Monitoring

Satellite monitoring uses advanced remote sensing technologies, such as optical imaging or synthetic aperture radar (SAR), to track agricultural land, especially in areas like paddy fields. This method offers a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to traditional monitoring, which often requires time-consuming and resource-intensive expert field surveys.

With [free access to satellite imagery](https://eos.com/blog/free-satellite-imagery-sources/), agriculturists can monitor large geographic areas with high temporal resolution, making it easier to map crop conditions over time.

This information helps them make informed decisions about fertilization, pest management, and harvesting logistics. Additionally, satellite monitoring assists in weather pattern assessments and soil moisture tracking. 

### 4. Regenerative Agriculture

Regenerative agriculture emphasizes practices that enhance soil health and improve water quality to conserve and boost biodiversity. This approach benefits crop health and quality in the long run and contributes to environmental sustainability. 

The [global market for regenerative agriculture](https://www.precedenceresearch.com/regenerative-agriculture-market) has been gaining traction, with its value growing by approximately $975.20 million in 2022. Projections suggest it could reach around 4,290.92 million by 2032, reflecting a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15.97% from 2023 to 2032.

### 5. Tech Solutions for Animals

As more people become concerned about how animals are treated, technology is stepping in to help improve their well-being. One notable development is [Precision Livestock Farming (PLF)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/veterinary-science-and-veterinary-medicine/precision-livestock-farming). This approach uses sensors and smart devices to monitor individual animals. Farmers can track health and behavior, helping them spot issues early on. Automated feeding systems ensure animals get the proper nutrition without adding stress.

[Wearable tech](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/10/2779) lets farmers monitor health in real time, catching illnesses before they become severe and cutting down on antibiotic use. Besides, farms use tech to control their environments, ensuring animals live comfortably.
