### Safer Infrastructure, Better Grid Resilience: Using Computer Vision for Pipeline Inspections

Did you know that the energy industry is one of the largest adopters of artificial intelligence technologies? From [optimising resource extraction](https://intellias.com/ai-in-energy-sector-benefits/#:~:text=AI%20enhances%20exploration%20processes%20in,energy%20sources%20without%20extra%20effort.) to ensuring the reliability of energy delivery, AI is transforming the way we power our world. And yet, one of the most fascinating applications of AI in this field is relatively less talked about  – pipeline inspection.

Pipeline inspection refers to the examination of pipelines for defects and damages, to ensure safety and hazard-free operations in the energy industry. These inspections are carried out both internally and externally by various methods and technologies. Pipeline inspection primarily ensures efficiency and safety in the oil and gas industries. But how can this task be revolutionised by computer vision?
