## Our Road to CVOps 

Our team has been hard at work making some big changes to make Picsellia the most complete European end-to-end [**CVOps platform**](https://www.picsellia.com/product-overview)—in short, MLOps applied to computer vision.

Our new release incorporates the latest tools and features to manage your entire MLOps pipeline in one single place, especially optimized for computer vision.

Until now, Picsellia only centralized dataset management, experiment tracking and model training tools in a single platform to assist data scientists in their research phase. However, since the Deep Learning market has evolved beyond just research, we wanted to go a step further and create a stack that covered the entire MLOps pipeline for computer vision projects. 

## What is New in Picsellia? 

> It’s time to put Computer Vision models in production!

Through an easy-to-use and powerful ecosystem, our end-to-end CVOps solution simplifies and centralizes workflows, for research to production, while promoting collaboration across distributed teams.

Today, Picsellia does not only cover the research stage, but also the production pipeline—and it’s up to you whether to make full use of the platform as a whole, or integrate it with other existing tools. 

Here are some of the new features:

### **1. Serverless Model Deployment**

Put your computer vision model in production in a minute. Now you can jump from a trained experiment to a model put in production in a robust and scalable infrastructure. Our serverless deployment solution comes with an out-of-the box monitoring suite.
