[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/topics/computer-vision) defines computer vision as “*a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that uses machine learning and neural networks to teach computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs—and to make recommendations or take actions when they see defects or issues.*”

It falls under the umbrella of AI which extracts information from images. As AI gains momentum, so does computer vision in several industries. Today, computer vision is being used in everything – from [drone technology](/post/the-confluence-of-computer-vision-and-drone-technology) to [inspecting production lines](/post/computer-vision-in-production-lines-manufacturing) in [manufacturing](/industry/manufacturing). 

But who are the ‘**Early Adopter Companies**’ of Computer Vision? 

(NOTE: *An ‘early adopter’ is any person/organization who starts using a product or service as soon as it becomes available.* They are often seen as **risk bearers** of innovations. They are more popular in the tech industry due to their willingness to adopt and try new technologies, which helps further advance software.)

## Information Technology Companies

### Google: 

Google is often seen as a ‘pioneer’ in the field due to its massive contribution to the development of this software. A brief look at Google’s computer vision journey:

- 2009 - ‘[Google Goggles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Goggles)’, a one-of-its-kind computer vision project launched as an image recognition application by Google. Consumers could now search the world wide web using the pictures they captured via their mobile cameras. It could recognize landmarks, and logos and solve sudoku puzzles.
- 2014 - The [acquisition of DeepMind](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jan/27/google-acquires-uk-artificial-intelligence-startup-deepmind), a leadering AI research company which significantly impacts Google’s capabilities in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. This move is strategic for Google to develop its own advanced vision algorithms.
