AI has immensely contributed to computer vision’s advances over the past years. It’s the field where most AI research is being conducted. But what is going on during 2022, what are the most important present research trends?

For this article we researched and studied the most important research trends so you don’t have to. We compressed them in one article so you need to look no further!

## Multimodal Learning

The ultimate goal of artificial intelligence is to achieve Artificial  General Intelligence (AGI). AGI is AI that is capable of understanding and performing any intellectual task, similar to human beings. That is in contrast to the current AI models that are “narrow”, in the sense that they are trained to perform just one task or very similar tasks.

Multimodal Learning is considered by many a step towards the direction of AGI. Multimodal models are able to process multiple types of data. Processing and capturing information from multiple different sources (ie. image, text, audio, sensor data) allows an AI agent to create a richer conceptual understanding and perceive its surroundings more holistically.

Imagine the task of sentiment analysis. You can train a model to detect emotion from face images. Conversely, you could train a model on sentiment analysis of language phrases or capture the voice tone of audio phrases. However, training on all 3 simultaneously allows the model to capture emotion cues from all sources, ie. facial expression, tone of voice as well as sentiment of the phrase being pronounced.

A lot of research has focused on Multi-Modal Learning during the last couple of years and some exceptional models, able to achieve SOTA performance in multiple tasks without fine tuning (zero shot learning) have been developed. Prominent examples include OpenAI’s [CLIP](https://openai.com/blog/clip/) model which was trained to model the similarity between images and their associated captions, and Meta’s [FLAVA ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04482?fbclid=IwAR2qXIHcV35jMCwPdBth3b7cS3VmuXIXz6WmUSa-Zd809T9CtdJRW3FjjQ8)and [data2vec](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-first-high-performance-self-supervised-algorithm-that-works-for-speech-vision-and-text/). Another common approach these models have is that they utilize Self-Supervised Learning, which brings us to our next research trend.

## Self Supervised Learning

*Yan LeCun, the VP and chief AI scientist at MetaAI, called self-supervised learning the “Dark Matter of Intelligence”. Meta, but also other AI leader institutions are working very hard towards the direction of self-supervision as a new learning-paradigm that aims to replace classic Supervised Learning which has become unscalable. *

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) is a learning paradigm where pseudo labels are generated automatically from unlabelled data. These labels are not assigned based on the target task but rather on a general pre-training task that aims to teach and give the model “a general intuition about the world”. By training on this task with orders of magnitude more data compared to supervised learning, models are able to capture features that are otherwise difficult to discover. It offers an intelligent way of exploiting the unprecedented amounts of unlabeled data that is available today.

All the contemporary huge NLP models like GPT-3, BERT and the more recent [BLOOM](https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom), make use of self-supervision in order to successfully be trained. SSL revolutionized NLP and is now revolutionizing the way we train vision models. But, it’s not just huge models that benefit, read our article to learn [how you can reduce your training data needs by exploiting self-supervised learning.](https://www.picsellia.com/post/reduce-training-data-with-self-supervised-learning)

## Text-to-Image with Diffusion Models

Probably the most popular trend of 2022 is text-to-image Diffusion models. Models such as [DALL-E  2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) and [Imagen ](https://imagen.research.google/)have been making headlines across the news. In case you haven’t already heard, such models are able to generate original images from just natural language sentences!
