# **An In-Depth Guide to Contrastive Learning in AI**

When a child is learning to recognize animals, he may struggle in the beginning, to differentiate between various animals. However, by comparing similar and dissimilar animals, they gradually learn to identify common features within a species across species. 

It perfectly illustrates the concept behind contrastive learning, which aims to learn the general features of a dataset by teaching the model which data points are similar or different.
