***Images are to object detection, just as videos are to...***

If you thought about object tracking, you guessed correctly. On a fundamental level, an image is a visual snapshot, and a video is a sequence of images, so what makes object tracking different from object detection?

This article discusses the underlying concept behind object tracking and what differentiates it from object detection. Then, it highlights the challenges associated with implementing object tracking and how to overcome them.

## How does object tracking work?

Object tracking involves using computer vision algorithms to monitor the motion or location of objects in moving images. Object labeling and motion tracking are the two major concepts in object tracking but are absent in object detection.

- **Object labeling**: In object tracking, each detected object in the frame is given a unique label, and its location coordinates are stored.
- **Motion tracking**: The stored location coordinates are then used to estimate the object's future location and thus track it.
