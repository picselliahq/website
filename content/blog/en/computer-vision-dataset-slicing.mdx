Computer Vision (CV) deals with intelligent models that understand and interpret image datasets for various purposes. Some common CV tasks include image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. We use these models daily, e.g., unlocking your iPhone via faceID involves multiple CV-related processing.

Computer Vision also includes more complex applications, such as self-driving cars, which are trained over massive datasets. Handling such large-scale data is a significant problem for Computer Vision engineers. Images occupy substantially more memory than other data forms, and even a basic dataset is worth a few gigabytes. One common way to deal with such substantial files is dataset slicing. Let's talk more about it.

## What is Dataset Slicing?

Slicing refers to dividing a [dataset](https://www.picsellia.com/dataset-management) into multiple parts. The split can be performed randomly or according to a pre-defined key and can be performed across rows, columns, or any other dimension. 

For example, if we have a table with 1000 rows and 5 columns (1000 x 5), we can slice this table across the columns and make divisions of 1000x3 and 1000x2. Or we can place slices along the rows forming two smaller tables with a 500x5 dimension for each.

The number of slices and the dimension to slice along solely depends on your use case.

## Why Do We Slice Datasets?

Data Slicing is commonly performed for data science and machine learning tasks. Here’s why data science practitioners need dataset slicing.

### 1. Train-Test Split

During machine learning training, data is trained using some portion of the data and then tested on an unseen subset. This unseen dataset, called the `test` dataset, is generated by slicing the primary data into two parts. The larger set (usually 80% of the overall data) is called the `training set,` and the smaller (usually 20% of the overall information) is called the test set. The train set trains the model, and the test set evaluates it.
