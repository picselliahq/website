Production lines (i.e., assembly or manufacturing plants) are the backbone of manufacturing industries. Tasks and operations on production lines requiring visual assessment are challenging to manage with human supervision.

Fortunately, modern manufacturing sectors quickly embrace smart technologies such as computer vision to eliminate inefficiencies in executing visual tasks. According to a report by Global Market Insights, Inc​., [the use of computer vision in the manufacturing sector alone is expected to surpass USD 6 billion by 2032](https://www.gminsights.com/industry-analysis/computer-vision-market). 

How are manufacturing industries leveraging computer vision solutions to manage vision-based tasks and operations in their production lines?

This article highlights how computer vision addresses critical challenges and streamlines operations in production lines. Then, it showcases real-world examples of how industries successfully implement computer vision solutions and provides insights into what it takes to develop and deploy them for manufacturing.

## Solving production line challenges with Computer Vision

Production lines are organized systems of robots or machines engineered to optimize efficiency, reduce errors, and maintain consistent product quality. Computer vision software enhances these systems, equipping them with the ability to perform complex visual tasks and operations more effectively, such as:

### Part misalignment

Frequent movement and vibrations during the operation of machines and robots in production lines can cause parts to deviate from their proper calibration. These misalignments can lead to assembly or production errors, resulting in defects, rework, slower production, and increased costs.

Computer vision systems can detect and identify misaligned parts in real-time by analyzing images of products or machine components along the production line. When a misalignment is detected, the system can automatically trigger adjustments or send alerts for re-alignment, ensuring the process continues smoothly.

### Defects detection

Product quantity inspections are critical processes typically performed between or at the end of production lines to ensure that only flawless products leave the facility. These inspections are often time-consuming and tedious for human supervisors. Additionally, some products may appear perfect but have minor defects that are difficult to detect manually.  

Computer vision solutions automate the inspection and detection of product flaws that human inspectors might overlook, such as cracks, scratches, or improper assembly, drastically reducing the likelihood of defective products reaching customers.
