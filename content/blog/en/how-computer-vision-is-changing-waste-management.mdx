## Innovative Waste Management in the EU: A Step Towards Sustainability

Climate change is not news. However, the methods to tackle environmental issues have become more niche over time. As the world grapples with the pressing climate change issue, innovative waste management solutions become critical. 

[A report by the European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20180328STO00751/sustainable-waste-management-what-the-eu-is-doing#:~:text=Every%20year%202.1%20billion%20tonnes,more%20recycling%20and%20less%20landfilling.) stated that the European Union (EU) produced 2.1 billion metric tons of waste every year. Hence, it is no surprise that over the last year, the EU has taken an active initiative to reduce the total amount of waste through efficient waste management, reducing the use of landfills, and promoting recycling and composting. The EU's current target remains to become a [circular economy by 2050](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20210128STO96607/how-the-eu-wants-to-achieve-a-circular-economy-by-2050). But what exactly is a circular economy?

## Understanding the Circular Economy: The Path to Sustainable Growth

The UN defines a circular economy as “a system of production, exchange, and sharing enabling social progress, the preservation of natural capital, and economic development. Its ultimate aim is to disconnect economic growth from the depletion of natural resources by creating innovative products, services, business models, and public policies, taking into consideration all flows throughout the life of the product or service.”
