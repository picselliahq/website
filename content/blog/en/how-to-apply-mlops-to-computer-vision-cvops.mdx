We are all familiar with the Software Development lifecycle, in which development and operations teams collaborate to create software and applications. They develop and test these applications using Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines, ensuring that the software has the most up-to-date features and updates to solve any user or business problems.

## What is Machine Learning?

The process of learning from data to achieve valuable insights is called Machine Learning. It is a technical term that refers to the tools and techniques to create Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

With the digital transformation of the last 50 years, data has spread all over the world, making professionals across all sectors develop a keen interest in learning from this sea of data to find insights and predictions or prevent repeating mistakes.

Before, developers used to write algorithms using a programming language that defined the tasks to perform. Now, the paradigm has changed in the sense that the algorithm is just a canvas that defines how the machine is supposed to learn itself from some input data, for a given task.

## What is MLOps? And Why It Matters

We all know about DevOps—a development process that became popular in the early 2000' s with agile project development methodologies as its background, which been working well until now.

At this point, every organization started wanting to add machine learning capabilities to its product. Since the ML lifecycle is similar to the software development lifecycle, a new field called MLOps was developed that included steps dedicated to machine learning systems.

MLOps refers to a set of steps and processes that data scientists, IT, and production teams use to deliver efficient machine learning products.

MLOps involve the following steps:

- Framing business objectives

- Searching for relevant data

- Preparing and processing data (Data Engineering)

- Developing and training the Machine Learning model

- Building and automating a machine learning pipeline

- Deploying the model via static or dynamic deployment

In MLOps, development/production teams use the CI/CD/CT method to deliver high-performing machine learning systems.

**- Continuous Integration (CI)** is not only about testing and validating the codes and components, but also testing and validating data, data schemas, and models.

**- Continuous Delivery (CD)** is not only about delivering a single software or a web application but, instead, a machine learning system (an ML training pipeline).

**- Continuous Training (CT) **is a step exclusive to machine learning systems where the deployed models are retrained with changing data to prevent them from degrading.

Recently, we've noticed an increasing interest in MLOps since every organization is looking to deploy ML systems faster, at scale, and reliably. In March 2021, a research report on [what data scientists seek to accomplish with MLOps,](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.08942) stated that according to **40% of the respondents**, a majority of work revolves around solving problems in the categories of computer vision, predictive analysis, and time-series data. Many data scientists felt that the most significant issues were related to data management, when data was messy, inaccessible, or plain non-identifiable.

## How Can MLOps Help Achieve Computer Vision Goals?

Computer Vision is a field of Artificial Intelligence where learning algorithms are applied on image-like input types like videos, pictures and hyper-spectral images. It really differs from the other types of data like tabular data or text because of the size of the files (therein datasets) where Tera Octets is a common order of magnitude.

In short, Computer Vision enables machines to see, observe and make sense of the images presented before them, just like humans do.
