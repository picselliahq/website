A lot of tasks in computer vision require images taken in the wild (i.e. road, events, etc.), but building a dataset for human behavior related tasks can be tricky. As you must know, GDPR does not allow storage of pictures taken without consent.

It would be a shame to limit AI applications due to GDPR right? At Picsellia, we are dedicated to help people build better computer vision models, so it only made sense for us to build an anonymizer to help you build GDPR-compliant human-related datasets.

### What Does a GDPR-Compliant Image Look Like?
