We’ve been seeing a lot of our customers implementing ML Flow as a part of their MLOps roadmap, they tend to want something more for computer vision, and that’s when Picsellia comes in.

While MLFlow is great for managing the entire classical machine learning model lifecycle with its strong experiment tracking, model management, and deployment capabilities, **it doesn't quite meet the specific needs of computer vision.**

That's where Picsellia comes in, filling these gaps with its tailored MLOps tools for computer vision, ranging from visual data annotation, centralized data management, and advanced visualization to production data & model monitoring. By combining MLFlow’s comprehensive ML lifecycle management with Picsellia’s specialized features for computer vision, you can create a workflow that is streamlined, efficient, and scalable.

This integration ensures you have high-quality data, better-performing models, and smooth deployment, speeding up the development and deployment of robust computer vision solutions.
