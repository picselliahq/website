> ‍***TL;DR.**** Building a complete and well-designed solution from scratch can take up to two years where you’ll destine your resources to just that purpose, time you could use to develop your product and train your ML models. Just hiring a complete team for a year could cost you up to 400k€ (and there are more costs to it!). So, unless you’ve got a very specific use-case that needs a tailored solution, it’s preferable to buy one that fits your needs. There are hundreds of companies that have put a lot of effort and money into building all types of platforms for different use cases. So, chances are, you’ll end up building something similar to what there’s out there. *

## Introduction

As more and more companies embrace the benefits of machine learning operations (MLOps), the question on C-level executive’s minds is: **should we build or buy an MLOps platform?**

Building your own MLOps platform requires expertise in many areas like data science, software engineering, data architecture, and DevOps. It also requires a significant amount of time and resources. But, at the same time, building your own ML platform can help you to customize your solution for your specific needs and industry requirements. 

On the other hand, buying an off-the-shelf MLOps stack means that it has already been built for you (and a lot of effort has been put in its making and support), letting you focus on training and maintaining your models.

Some companies have decided to build an entire MLOps platform that adapts to their needs, while others have purchased platforms that don’t have all the tools they need for their ML projects, having to build additional tools to cover their needs. If you’re not sure whether to buy or build your own end-to-end MLOps platform, we’ll give you some insights that will help you decide.

## When should I build an MLOps platform?

Building an ML platform in-house could be a good option for a highly specific use case that needs particularly customized features. However, in some cases, it is also possible to customize third-party solutions to some extent, so you can suit your specific needs and industry requirements. 

The best example for specific industry needs is the medical images industry. Given the multitude of data formats typically used in this field, it’s really complicated to find an out-of-the-box platform that is able to handle all of them. 

On a different note, building your own MLOps platform means that you have full control of the data, which means building your own (high) standard of security. If you buy a commercial MLOps Platform, you will have to agree on using the security standards of your provider.

 

## When should I buy an MLOps platform?

Buying an MLOps platform is a great choice for companies that are looking for quick implementation, speed, and efficiency. 

One of the most important advantages of buying an MLOps solution is that you can focus on what's important to your business while the platform handles everything else. This is, you’ll have more time to develop your product and focus on data science, and avoid falling behind as your competitors grow.

Companies that buy off-the-shelf MLOps platforms can be assured of the quality of the technology they're investing in. A lot of time and resources have gone into developing these technologies. 

Already existing end-to-end platforms let your teams work and collaborate in just one platform, without having to use various tools to complete the MLOps life cycle. 

These advantages boost your teams’ productivity and allow them to develop your products faster.

## What do I need for building a quality MLOps platform?

To build accurate ML models, it’s essential that you consider the iteration speed of your experiments, and this is where MLOps tools come into play. However, the process of building a well-designed MLOps platform in-house implies having a robust and scalable infrastructure that adapts to your needs as your organization grows.

At the same time, a strong infrastructure is needed for deploying production ML systems. This way, you can continuously retrain your models on incoming data to keep your models representative of the real world without disruption. 

The features that bring the most value to an MLOps platform are not always the most obvious ones. For example, an alerting and notification system that triggers on user input needs, like prediction review or model performance validation could appear as a gadget, but can surely save you a lot of time (and downtime).

At Picsellia, we developed a platform that covers the whole MLOps stack, including automatic workflows with notifications that alert you when new data that needs labeling arrives or when your model needs particular attention. This way, you’ll easily identify any model drift or model degradation and handle it in time.
