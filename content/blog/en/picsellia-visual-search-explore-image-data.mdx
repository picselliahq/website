The ability to efficiently explore and manage vast datasets is crucial. Visual search technology is making it quicker and easier than ever. At its core, visual search allows users to explore massive image libraries, find similar images, and even identify specific features within a dataset. In this blog post, we'll dive into the capabilities of visual search, why it's important, and how it's transforming image data exploration.

## What is Visual Search? 

Visual search is a tool in Picsellia that allows users to query their datalake or a dataset of images based on either* visual similarity *with the image-to-image function, or based on *specific text inputs *with the text-to-image function. 

Image-to-image search allows you to find all images similar to one sample image. Let's say you have images of a city, and you want to find and delete all the images of football fields. You take one image of a football field, and use it in the image-to-image search to find and delete all the similar images.
