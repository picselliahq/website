This is the last article of our series about MLOps, in the lasts articles we went from MLOps lvl 0 and 1, if you want to catch up, here are the links of the previous articles:

Introducing MLOps lvl 0:[ https://www.picsellia.com/post/what-is-mlops-and-why-its-important](https://www.picsellia.com/post/what-is-mlops-and-why-its-important)

Introducing MLOps lvl 1:[ https://www.picsellia.com/post/road-to-mlops-part-2](https://www.picsellia.com/post/road-to-mlops-part-2)

In this third part, we will cover the lvl 2 of MLOps and present some tools and techniques to achieve it.

## **What is MLOps Level 2?**

Level 2 goes a step further in terms of what we can do and the kind of system we are now able to operate. By that we mean large-scale, high-frequency systems. Data scientists can now focus on analyzing data and becoming data-centric, they can also spend more time on testing new techniques, algorithms, and analyses.

You have developed tools to package and containerize their code, so when they are done, the whole pipeline is automatically tested and deployed. This means that we have achieved fully automated Continuous Integration and Delivery.

The triggers of the pipeline renewal are multiple, as we monitor everything in a lot of ways at different stages, every metric monitored can trigger the pipeline. Or everything can be scheduled, it's your choice. The few manual steps that remain compulsory are the data and error analysis, to ensure that the training data and the models meet our high standards.

Now, let's talk about some tools to help you progress in your path to level 2 (or at least level 1) of MLOps Maturity.

## **Road to MLOps**

We are going to cover some of the most important steps that come to mind when we deal with MLOps.

- The first step (one of the most important ones) is deployment, because it’s the one that should finally solve your business case or project (at least in the beginning).

- Then it comes to monitoring, there are no MLOps without proper ways to monitor the underlying systems.

- And finally, all the different steps that characterize the different levels of MLOps: the feedback loop, the Continuous Training, and the Continuous Delivery of models.

The last points depend on the company or project requirements, organization, teams, etc.

## **Cloud Model Deployment**

[Deployment](https://www.picsellia.com/model-deployment) is one of the most exciting stages of the project, where you can finally see your model in action, study its performance, but also pray that it never breaks!

Here is a diagram of what we consider the bare minimum of configuration and packaging for deploying a model into ‘production’. Everything less complete than this can’t be considered MLOps ready.
