YOLOv8 is the most recent edition in the highly renowned collection of models that implement the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture. This development was done by Ultralytics, a squad renowned for their work on YOLOv3 (PyTorch fork) and YOLOv5.

Continuing the pattern set by YOLOv5, YOLOv6 and YOLOv7, we now have access not only to object detection, but also **instance segmentation** and **image classification**. The model itself was constructed in PyTorch, and is **capable of running on both CPUs and GPUs**. Similarly to YOLOv5, we also have several exports such as ONNX and Tensorflow SavedModel (which are not implemented yet).

The fact that we are still seeking the Papers with Code benchmark to distinguish YOLOv8 from the other state of the art real-time models is an issue to assess the “real SOTA claimed”. So, the only way to know if YOLOv8 can be a good fit for your use-case, is to try it out!

**In this tutorial, we will provide you with a detailed guide on how to train the YOLOv8 object detection model on a custom dataset. **You will learn how to use the fresh API, how to prepare the dataset and, most importantly, **how to train and validate the model**. 

Let's get started!

In this article, we will try to explain how to quickly integrate this new architecture into your Picsellia Workflow. 

The main things we are going to explore will be: 

- How to convert a COCO Dataset into YOLO Format.
- How to Log Training Metrics to Picsellia platform.
- Saving the trained weights in order to resume training.
- Monitor your YOLO models with Picsellia monitoring service. 

Obviously, **we made a github repo to help you with the coding**, you can find it here:

You can also find some **relevant snippets** in our documentation: [https://documentation.picsellia.com/recipes](https://documentation.picsellia.com/recipes)
