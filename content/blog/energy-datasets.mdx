## Harnessing Energy Datasets: Revolutionizing Infrastructure with Computer Vision

According to the [International Trade Association](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/united-kingdom-energy#:~:text=The%20UK%20has%202.4GW,61.5GW%20across%201%2C319%20sites.), the ​​UK generates 2.4GW/2.6GWh of operational energy storage across 161 sites, with an additional 20.2 GW in planning. While this seems to put the UK in the top 5 global energy producers, there is still room for growth. The vast network of energy infrastructure systems that transport energy from generation plants to homes and industries plays a vital role in the energy generation of any country. The energy infrastructure must support the energy being generated and distributed; otherwise, there would be a mass waste of energy. By leveraging computer vision, the energy industry can optimize existing energy infrastructure for better energy distribution, real-time fault detection, and remote monitoring of infrastructural systems.

This article will discuss the various energy datasets that computer vision engineers can use to exponentially optimize the current state of energy infrastructure in the energy industry, as well as some of the challenges facing the use of AI in the energy infrastructure industry and how to overcome them.
