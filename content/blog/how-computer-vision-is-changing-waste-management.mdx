## Innovative Waste Management in the EU: A Step Towards Sustainability

Climate change is not news. However, the methods to tackle environmental issues have become more niche over time. As the world grapples with the pressing climate change issue, innovative waste management solutions become critical. 

[A report by the European Parliament](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20180328STO00751/sustainable-waste-management-what-the-eu-is-doing#:~:text=Every%20year%202.1%20billion%20tonnes,more%20recycling%20and%20less%20landfilling.) stated that the European Union (EU) produced 2.1 billion metric tons of waste every year. Hence, it is no surprise that over the last year, the EU has taken an active initiative to reduce the total amount of waste through efficient waste management, reducing the use of landfills, and promoting recycling and composting. The EU's current target remains to become a [circular economy by 2050](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/topics/en/article/20210128STO96607/how-the-eu-wants-to-achieve-a-circular-economy-by-2050). But what exactly is a circular economy?

## Understanding the Circular Economy: The Path to Sustainable Growth

The UN defines a circular economy as “a system of production, exchange, and sharing enabling social progress, the preservation of natural capital, and economic development. Its ultimate aim is to disconnect economic growth from the depletion of natural resources by creating innovative products, services, business models, and public policies, taking into consideration all flows throughout the life of the product or service.”

## The Urgent Need for Effective Waste Management

Achieving a circular economy may seem daunting, but it is imperative given the current condition of the global environment. It is crucial to efficiently tackle the waste generated from the product life cycle to minimize its environmental effects and extract maximum utility from it. 

[According to the World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2018/09/20/global-waste-to-grow-by-70-percent-by-2050-unless-urgent-action-is-taken-world-bank-report), inadequate solid waste management worldwide contributes significantly to climate change, accounting for roughly 5% of global carbon emissions. It also leads to plastic pollution, which inflicts an estimated $13 billion in damage to marine environments annually. Hence, improper waste management is both environmentally and economically unfeasible. It becomes imperative to put systems in place that make waste management efficient and effective. 

## How Technology is Revolutionizing Waste Sorting

With rapid technological development, tasks like sorting waste material have become much simpler and more efficient. For example, [Altaroad](https://www.altaroad.com/), based in France, leverages technology to enhance waste assortment efficiency. The company provides waste and material monitoring and management solutions with automated traceability for construction and industrial sites. By offering real-time monitoring of materials and waste transported by heavy goods vehicles, Altaroad increases efficiency and streamlines operations. Features such as intelligent weighing systems, camera tracking, and automatic alerts for over- or underloading help reduce transport costs, improve safety, and minimize environmental impact by tracing carbon emissions.

[PellencST](https://www.pellencst.com/), a leading waste sorting machine manufacturer, is devoted to achieving a circular economy and is one of the 99 French companies to have [signed the French Business Climate Pledge in 2019](https://www.societegenerale.com/sites/default/files/documents/Document%20RSE/french-business-climate-pledge-2019-eng.pdf). The company focuses on improving sorting systems using cutting-edge technologies, such as AI-based quality control, to achieve accurate material management, which helps reduce operational expenses and environmental effects. Pellenc ST, with 2,500 machines deployed across over 40 countries, is a leading force in the French market and a significant international player. 

Faced with increasing demands for sophisticated sorting tasks beyond the reach of conventional sensors—such as sorting silicone cartridges and enhancing paper/cardboard separation—PellencST turned to Computer Vision technology. By being a pioneer in integrating computer vision (CV) into its systems, PellencST has significantly bolstered its market position. 

The integration of CV technology, supported by Picsellia's advanced CV platform, enabled PellencST to [reduce the development and adaptation time for CV models by 90%](/use-cases/how-pellencst-cut-their-time-to-model-by-90-percent), thereby greatly enhancing operational efficiency. This ability to rapidly develop and customize solutions has solidified PellencST’s competitive advantage and reinforced its leadership in the industry while allowing the company to maintain its devotion to a circular economy.

## Enhancing Waste Management with Picsellia's Technological Solutions

The EU's journey towards a circular economy is a collaborative effort that relies on innovative technologies and partnerships. As the EU continues to pursue its ambitious goals, the role of technological collaborations will be critical in paving the way for a sustainable and competitive future. Investing in these technologies is a step towards sustainability and a strategic move to stay ahead in an evolving industry. 

Picsellia's Computer Vision platform transforms the waste management industry by helping major players build sorting processes more precisely and efficiently. Companies like [Altaroad](/use-cases/how-altaroad-saved-time-operating-models-in-production-with-picsellia) and PellencST have partnered with Picsellia to optimize their computer vision operations, enabling models' rapid development, deployment, and monitoring. This collaboration has not only enhanced their competitiveness but also advanced their environmental initiatives.

Picsellia's technology facilitates sophisticated sorting tasks beyond the capabilities of conventional sensors, such as identifying silicone cartridges and improving paper/cardboard separation. This technological edge is crucial for companies committed to achieving the EU's circular economy goals by 2050.
