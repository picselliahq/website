In a recent episode of **Pixel Perfect**, our CTO Pierre-Nicolas Tiffreau sat down with **Hugues Poiget, CEO of Scortex**, to discuss the evolution of computer vision in industrial automation. From the early challenges of defect detection to the transition toward anomaly detection and real-time data insights, this conversation sheds light on** what it really takes to bring AI from concept to production.**

This blog post captures the key takeaways from that discussion, but if you want to dive deeper, you can** listen to the full episode**[** here**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3tipG086R55j4CPrPaBETz?si=3a80cbfbea0a48f6)**.** Note: the podcast is in French.

### **1. The Initial Ambition and the Industrial Reality**‍

When we talk about computer vision applied to industry, we naturally think of defect detection at the heart of production lines. This is precisely the focus of Scortex, a company that, from the outset, has leveraged computer vision to develop a comprehensive industrial product capable of inspecting and automatically classifying parts at a very high rate. In a context where competition continually drives factories to produce faster and more precisely, defects do not magically disappear: the greater the production complexity and speed, the greater the likelihood of defects. Initially, Scortex’s goal was simply to identify every non-compliant part and remove it at the end of the line. This promise seems straightforward, almost intuitive: just train a model, attach a camera to it, and automatically separate good items from defective ones. Yet, real-world conditions quickly revealed their complexity: the fine tuning of cameras and lighting setups, the unpredictable or occasionally puzzling cadence of a production line, specialized communication protocols, or even the scarcity of certain types of defects all made it clear that computer vision alone would not suffice. An entire hardware and software ecosystem was needed, along with powerful data-reporting features to help engineers and operators understand precisely why defects appeared. **Beyond algorithmic performance, the true industrial requirement lies in how the people working on the line, day in and day out, adopt the system and interpret the alerts it generates.**

Over the years, Scortex has focused on making sure its customers succeed and given its engineers the freedom to experiment and work closely with clients. This explains how an intern hired to set up neural networks eventually became the company’s general manager. Rather than being just a one-off example, this story shows how, at a startup, you need to do a bit of everything—from R&D to installing cameras for clients, all while constantly rethinking technical decisions.
