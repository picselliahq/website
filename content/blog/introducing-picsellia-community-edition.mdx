## Mission statement 

At Picsellia, our mission is simple: **accelerate the deployment of VisionAI technology in the real world**. We believe that building VisionAI solutions is more about engineering than science. Success lies in ensuring the right data reaches the right model at the right time, every time.

To achieve this, we provide an **end-to-end platform** designed to help you build, deploy, and maintain computer vision models efficiently. Our lean approach focuses on speed and iteration because, in VisionAI, the journey from the first deployed model to the tenth is where breakthrough results happen.

*But what if you’re not quite at the stage of deploying your first model?*

That’s okay. We’re here to meet you where you are.

## We want to grow with you

If you’re just starting out, experimenting, researching, or building your first proof of concept (PoC), we understand your challenges. Limited budgets, the need for flexibility, and often, a lack of internal AI expertise are all common hurdles.

We want to help you move from a brilliant idea to your first deployed model without the frustration of juggling datasets on your laptop or Google Drive (trust us, we’ve seen it happen too many times).

Your first step to success is a **bulletproof data strategy**, and for that, you need a **Data Engine**, one that evolves with your VisionAI ambitions.

## Our commitments

We’re not here to oversell or overpromise—we’re here to deliver value. Here’s what you can count on with Picsellia:

#### **Truly Free, Fully Featured**‍

Forget “fake free offers.” Our free platform gives you a scalable, production-grade environment to build robust datasets from day one.

#### **Your Data, Your Ownership**‍

Your data is your competitive advantage. Picsellia is ISO certified and deeply committed to data privacy. Connect your own storage to Picsellia or let us securely store it for you, never sent to third parties.

#### **No Magic, Just Results**‍

We won’t promise gimmicks like “auto-annotation.” While tools like pre-labeling exist, they’re just that, tools. Building great models takes effort, and our mission is to make that effort as seamless as possible.

## When is it a good time to upgrade to the Enterprise version? 

Our free platform is perfect for early-stage experimentation, but when you’re ready to scale your VisionAI operations, the Enterprise version will be your best partner.

Here’s what Enterprise offers:

- **Continuous training** with fresh production data.
- **Advanced monitoring** for seamless scaling.
- **Comprehensive model evaluation tools** for precision and performance.

When every point of accuracy matters, and you’re building production-grade pipelines, the Enterprise version is here to take your VisionAI operations to the next level.
