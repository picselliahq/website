We are very excited to announce a significant development, one we believe will advance the way custom computer vision models are built. Welcome **Picsellia Atlas**, an AI agent designed to enhance the development process for Vision AI.

While the capabilities of general Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), are expanding rapidly, a persistent challenge remains in the domain of **high-precision, custom computer vision**. These specialized applications often require more than general AI can provide, primarily due to the nature of the data involved.
