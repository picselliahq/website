## OpenCV Tutorials

[OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) is an excellent resource for beginners looking to dive into computer vision. As an open-source library, it offers a wide array of tutorials covering both basic and advanced topics like image processing, feature detection and extraction, video analysis, and camera calibration to advanced techniques like deep learning and face recognition using OpenCV's pre-trained models. OpenCV's tutorials are beginner-friendly, providing code samples in Python, making it easy for learners to experiment and gain hands-on experience. It’s widely used in both academic and industry settings, making it a key tool for those starting out in computer vision.
