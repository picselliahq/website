Unlike their early counterparts, today's drones are not just equipped to capture high-resolution images and videos. Thanks to computer vision, they can make sense of these visuals, and consequently, it has opened up new opportunities across numerous industries. In this article, we'll delve into how computer vision is driving the drone industry forward, its applications, and its challenges.

## **How Computer Vision Powers Drones**

In the drone industry, computer vision is applied by equipping drones with cameras and using algorithms to analyze the data captured by those cameras. The combination of computer vision and drones enables advanced analysis, interpretation, and decision-making based on visual information. 

The cameras capture images or videos of the surrounding environment during flight. They can range from RGB cameras to specialized sensors like thermal or multispectral cameras, depending on the application. The captured images or video frames are processed using computer vision algorithms, which can extract various visual features, detect objects, or segment the image into meaningful regions.
