[Pixel quality and file format are crucial properties of image data](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6228) to pay attention to when using them for any task. The choice of image file format can significantly impact your pixel quality, which the performance and efficiency of computer vision models rely upon. Various file formats provide high-pixel. Therefore, selecting the suitable format depends on the desired balance between information fidelity, file size, and processing speed. Understanding the interplay between format, data retention, and model performance is crucial for successful computer vision applications. Tag Image File Format (TIFF) is a high-pixel-quality image file format for storing images.

This article discusses the ins and outs of the powerful TIFF format and the tradeoffs involved in using it for computer vision.
