Computer vision is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field of artificial intelligence that involves analyzing and interpreting digital images, videos and other visual inputs. As the field continues to grow, there is a lot of investment in terms of time and effort to improve the models. 

This is typically achieved through iterative and experimental processes such as changing the model, running multiple experiments, and examining the results, then deciding whether the recent change in the model was positive and should be kept or discar**de**d.

‍

These cycles of experimenting can cause a great deal of confusion. It is easy to forget the changes you made in a certain experiment and whether the recent results are indeed better than the previous ones. Single experiments can take hours to complete and so you will try to save your time and execute multiple experiments simultaneously. This makes it even less manageable, and the confusion gets even worse.

‍

Experiment tracking provides the solution to this confusion. It involves keeping track of important information about different experiments when developing models. The information to be tracked could be: 

- Different versions of training data
- Hyperparameters of the model 
- Different ML models
- Codes used in model development

‍

Additionally, for some projects, you might track yet more information such as model weights, prediction distributions, model checkpoints, and hardware resources.

‍

Experiment tracking is implemented by ML teams in a variety of ways, including using GitHub, spreadsheets, or in-house platforms. However, using tools which are specifically for tracking and managing ML experiments is the most efficient choice.

‍

In this article, we discuss top tools which will help you track and manage your computer vision experiments.

## Top experiment tracking tools
