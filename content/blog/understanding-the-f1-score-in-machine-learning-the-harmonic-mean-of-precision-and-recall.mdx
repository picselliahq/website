## Introduction:

In the field of machine learning, accurately evaluating the performance of a model is crucial. Metrics such as precision, recall, and the F1 score play a significant role in assessing the effectiveness of a classification model. In this article, we will delve into the concept of the F1 score, its relationship with precision and recall, why it is advantageous to use the F1 score over solely relying on recall or precision, how to interpret the results, how to use the F1 score in machine learning with a computer vision example, and finally, introduce the concept of a confusion matrix to calculate the F1 score.

## Understanding Precision and Recall:

Before we explore the F1 score, it is important to comprehend two fundamental metrics: precision and recall.

### **Precision**:

Precision measures the proportion of correctly predicted positive instances out of all instances predicted as positive. It helps us understand how well the model classifies positive instances correctly. A high precision value indicates that the model has a low false positive rate. 

Precision is calculated using the formula:
