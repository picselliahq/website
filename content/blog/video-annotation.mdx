Video labeling, or video annotations, is the essential component of the [video dataset for training computer vision (CV) models](https://www.picsellia.com/dataset-management). The video annotations contain information about pixel areas from a continuous stream of pixels relevant to a computer vision task. The processes and methods for annotating video are different due to the complex nature of video data; they can present an added layer of intricate information that improves data quality and robustness, increasing the performance of computer vision models for various computer vision tasks.

This article focuses on video annotation's unique peculiarities for computer vision tasks that require tracking objects for understanding.
