## What is OCR? Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Software Explained

The omnipresence and exponential growth of information (data) and communication technology (ICT) make digitization a critical pillar in this era. Over time, diverse techniques of interacting with, storing, and retrieving data have evolved. Prior methods, like manual data entry or microfilm, were time-consuming, labor-intensive, or less accurate.

Enabling computers and machines with optical prowess, known as optical character recognition (OCR), revolutionized digitization. It equipped them with human-like visual abilities. This ability enabled them to input, access, transfer, consume, or process data faster and more efficiently, making data digitization seamless. It has grown beyond the mundane idea of scanning and converting a physical document into text format.

This article will provide an in-depth dive into OCR, from its definition and history to its underlying technologies and the most common (and valuable) applications.

## What is OCR, and why is it important?

Optical Character Recognition (OCR), as the name implies, recognizes characters optically. The technology enables computers to read text from digital image file formats like camera image files, image-only PDF files, scanned paper documents, printed documents, screenshots, handwritten text, etc., by identifying and recognizing each character in the digital image file. It scans, extracts, and converts characters from digital image files to machine-readable code.

OCR systems streamline workflows and boost productivity by creating an interface connecting the physical and digital worlds. It eliminates the need for humans to interface with data each time manually. This automatic interface allows computers to automate data entry, extraction, storage, analysis, or processing. The benefits of OCR automation for operations and processes involved in using text from digital image files include:

- Decrease in operational errors
- Reduce cost of operation
- Increase in efficiency 
- Minimizes human effort 
- Speeds up execution time 

## How does it work?

OCR systems understand visual information by augmenting the working principles of the human eyes and brain. Optical systems have a fundamental design of manipulating light through reflection or refraction. Like the eye, OCR systems adopt the concept of the reflection of light to form an image. Think of how a shadow forms when you project light over an object. A shadow is technically an image reflection of the original object in 2D (lower-dimensional).  

The eye encodes this 2D image as electric signals and sends them to the brain for interpretation. The brain decodes the signals to determine the object from the shape of its shadow.

### The technology behind OCR

The technology for translating text in images into electronic signals that machines can understand and use is broad. As such, there have been many different implementations of OCR over the years. However, OCR software generally comprises a three-step process of image preprocessing, classification (text detection and recognition), and post-processing. They utilize algorithms ranging from traditional image processing to machine learning or deep learning techniques. 

#### Preprocessing Layer

In a nutshell, this step implements a compression technique on the image that enhances the image's quality for the machine to make sense of and recognize text (characters). OCR software takes 2D image files as input. Irrespective of the stack of [preprocessing](https://www.picsellia.com/dataset-management) techniques used, it starts by scanning and copying the image content. The image processing component readjusts the scanned image's orientation and alignment to fit the dimensions and resolution of the scan with a deskewing method.

Since pixel (image density) values generally range from 0 to 255 and define the image's resolution, binarizing them to pixel values of 0s and 1s renders the scanned image in high contrast to form a bitmap. A bitmap is typically a lower-dimensional representation of the original 2D image. At this point, the depth (color) of the image is gone, leaving you only with black and white pixels. It's just like a shadow of the original image. White areas denoted by 1s denote the background, whereas black regions denoted by 0s denote characters.
